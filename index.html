        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          charity: water is a nonprofit organization founded in 2006 by Scott Harrison, who made a simple but life-changing decision: to dedicate his 31st birthday to raising funds for clean water. One act of generosity grew into a global movement to end the water crisis. We partner with local organizations and supporters to bring clean, sustainable water sources to developing countries. Over the years, charity: water has funded thousands of water projects across dozens of countries, serving millions of people. Together, through simple and generous acts, we can make a lasting difference in helping everyone, everywhere, have access to clean water.
